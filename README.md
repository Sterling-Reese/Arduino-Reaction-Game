# Arduino-Based Reaction Time Game

## Description
This project is a hardware-based game designed to measure and display a user's reaction time with millisecond precision. It serves as a practical introduction to embedded systems, C++ programming on a microcontroller, and basic circuit design.

## Technologies Used
* **Hardware:** Arduino Uno
* **Languages:** C++ (Arduino)
* **Components:** LEDs, Push-buttons, Breadboard

## How It Works
The program manages game logic by waiting for a random interval before triggering an LED. Upon trigger, it starts a timer and waits for a user to press a button, stopping the timer and displaying the result. The circuit is implemented on a breadboard to interface these components with the microcontroller.
